COMPANY: Our company history. After 20 years in the surf, skate and snowboard business, our founder took the first commercial yoga class offered in Vancouver and found the result exhilarating. The post-yoga feeling was so close to surfing and snowboarding that it seemed obvious that yoga was an ideology whose time had come (again). Cotton clothing was being used for sweaty, stretchy power yoga and seemed completely inappropriate to Chip, whose passion lay in technical athletic fabrics. From this, a design studio was born that became a yoga studio at night to pay the rent. Clothing was offered for sale and an underground yoga clothing movement was born. The success of the clothing was dependent on the feedback from yoga instructors who were asked to wear the products and provide their insights.
COMPANY isn't just a webshop. It's a part of the moonlight family. A community of Wiccans and Pagans that respect every living being, regardless of religion or sexual orientation. A community that promotes and support a lifestyle that is sustainable, healthful and meaningful. We believe that fashion can be much more than just a pretty outlook. All of our jewelry, clothing and magickal items are both fashionable and meaningful.
In the early nineties, COMPANY began as a simple wish. To feel warm, comfortable, and protected after an exhilarating day surfing the waves. We’ve come a long way since then. Though our team remains small, our wish has expanded. Our clothes, from durable outerwear to soft knits, are made from hemp and other organic materials. They are designed to fit well, last long, and exist in harmony with nature.
