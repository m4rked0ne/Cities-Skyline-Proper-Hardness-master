# Cities-Skyline-Proper-Hardness
Proper Hardness



Just a fork of the original, peeps are saying it needs updating for use with post AD patches, they are right.
Oringal author is apparently busy with his own full game now, cool.
I'm just at the stage of playing around with this for sh1ts and giggles to see what
really 'must' be updated just to function under post AD patches. 
No plans for actual enhancements, more of just maybe helping other people to get started in updating it.
ie.. get it 'functional' as is, then someone else can take over changing\adding too it etc.


This code has not been touched since Snowfall and I have stopped any work related to it and 
will not be updating it for future patches.

oct 2014:
Fork - KH_Build_001
- Mod loads and seems to work in a couple cities without blowing up.. building info shows, buildings seem
to actually grow, no real idea if it's 'really' working atm though but changing hard-ness does seem to have
effects in the game.

- I don't have any old files saved with this mod from the past, no way to test those atm
